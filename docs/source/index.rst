X-ray reflectometry reduction in Python
=======================================

:py:mod:`islatu` is an open-source pacakge for the reduction of x-ray reflectometry datasets.
Currently, :py:mod:`islatu` is developed at and supports data from `Diamond Light Source`_, however we are happy to work with others to enable data from other sources (including neutron sources).

These webpages include `API-level documentation`_ and information about some `workflows`_ that can be used for data reduction. There is also documentation on a `command line interface`_ that can be used to process reflectivity data without any python programming.

Contributing
------------
As with any coding project, there are many ways to contribue. To report a bug or suggest a feature, `open an issue on the github repository`_. If you would like to contribute code, we would recommend that you first `raise an issue`_ before diving into writing code, so we can let you know if we are working on something similar already. To e.g. fix typos in documentation or in the code, or for other minor changes, feel free to make pull requests directly.
