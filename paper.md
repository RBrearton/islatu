# Summary

The interaction between light and matter provides a sensitive probe of the
electronic structure of materials, on lengthscales determined by the difference
between the incident and outgoing wavevector of the light. Reflectometry
techniques involve scattering off the surface of a material, placing a detector
at a point such that any light reaching the detector must scatter through a
vector approximately parallel to the material's surface normal. Typically, for
various experiment-specific reasons, the raw data recorded by a detector will
not be proportional to the quantity of interest: the modulus squared of the
scattering matrix element
${\langle \vec{k}'\rvert}\hat{V}\lvert \vec{k} \rangle$. This is particularly
true when the length of the scattering vector
$|\vec{Q}| = |\vec{k} - \vec{k}'|$
is small, as is the case in reflectivity experiments. Then, in addition to
corrections that must be applied in any scattering experiment, the finite
size of the sample will affect the intensity of the
reflected beam, and it is often necessary to also correct for manual changes
to the beam's attenuation.

# Statement of need

`islatu` [@islatu_doi] is a Python package that simplifies the process of
reducing raw reflectometry data to data that has scientific value. This package
is designed to serve three purposes. Firstly, it provides an interface that can
be used to easily script custom reflectometry reduction pipelines. As the
fitting of reduced reflectivity data is an ill-posed problem, it is often
challenging to fit reflectivity curves, even with significant a-priori knowledge
of the structure of the material of interest. In some cases, this could be
related to errors made at data reduction time. `islatu` gives users the
ability to script data reduction at analysis time. This can be particularly
important when combining data sets with very different statistical uncertainties
(as would be the case when comparing neutron and x-ray reflectivity curves), as
errors are computed at data reduction time.

The second purpose of `islatu` is to provide a simple command-line interface,
that can be used in conjunction with a configuration file, to make reflectivity
reduction as automatic as possible. For example, at large-scale facilities, to
make the most of valuable beamtime, it is imperative that feedback on scans is
given to users as quickly as possible after a scan has been performed.

The final purpose of `islatu` is to simplify the handling of errors.
In `islatu`, statistical errors are automatically calculated and efficiently
propagated from the raw data to the reduced dataset using optimized
`numpy` [@harris2020array] routines. Despite their fundamental simplicity,
the propagation of uncertainties is error-prone. The assurance provided by
unit tested error propagation gives scientists more time to focus on data
analysis and less time spent worrying about re-implemening standard routines.

# Overview

There are a multitude of instruments around the world capable of recording
reflectivity data. `islatu` has been designed with this in mind, with a focus on
directly supporting international standard file formats (including the NeXus
[@konnecke2015nexus] and ORSO file formats) for the initial release,
making `islatu` compatible with most
modern synchrotrons. Thanks to `islatu`'s modular design, it is a
straightforward task to extend this functionality to other data sources; only
one parsing function needs to be added per supported file type.

`islatu` was designed for use with two-dimensional detectors, but support for
point detectors is complete and all reduction steps can be carried out with
identical syntax. To give an overview of `islatu`'s Python API, the first step
in any data reduction with `islatu` is to instantiate a `Profile` object. A full
reflectivity profile can generally be made up of more than one
$|\vec{Q}|$
scan, where $\vec{Q}$ is the probe particle's
scattering vector. To instantiate a `Profile` object, all that needs to be
provided is a list of source files and a function that can be used to parse
them. Once the profile has been instantiated, reduction takes place by calling
the `Profile` object's methods. For example, for an instance of `Profile`
named `my_profile` representing data acquired when a beam with a full width at
half maximum of 100 Âµm was incident on a sample of length 10 mm, our
reflectometry profile can be footprint-corrected by calling
`my_profile.footprint_correction(beam_width=100e-6, sample_size=10e-3)`.
The footprint correction is
exact for Gaussian beam profiles, and, along with all other reduction methods
available to `Profile` objects, propagates errors optimally (such that the
number of mathematical operations required to propagate the errors is
minimized). The other reduction methods can be used in entirely analogous ways,
taking arguments where necessary, and using metadata scraped from the raw data
files wherever possible.

As well as the abovedescribed Python API, `islatu` also features a command-line
interface. This application is used at the I07 beamline at Diamond
[@nicklin2016diamond]
to process reflectivity data immediately after acquisition. The command-line
interface runs a typical `islatu` processing script, where the arguments taken
by the various data reduction methods in the script are extracted from a combination
of a .yml configuration file and command-line arguments. The program outputs a
human-readable metadata-rich .dat file, which at present aims to comply with the
ORSO .ort file format definition, and will be converted to comply exactly with
the .ort file format at such a time as the ORSO file format specification is
finalized.
