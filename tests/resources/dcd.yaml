  # The islatu package needs this to find your data.
  # If your visit is "cm28211-3", but you are storing your data under a 
  # subdirectory of your visit directory called, for example "day1", then you
  # should set your visit id to be "cm28211-3/day1". Otherwise, islatu will 
  # look for your data in your visit's root directory and won't be able to find
  # it!

  # Islatu is actually also using this to work out where your data is stored

  # this will be written to your final .dat file.
